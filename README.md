Physics and Electrical Engineering Calculator


This repository contains a set of Python functions that can be used to calculate various physics and electrical engineering formulas, 
including those for frequency conversion, metric unit conversions, speed, time, distance, escape velocity, gravitational force, and more. 
It also includes functions for calculating electrical components in series and parallel circuits, Ohm's law, power law, and CMYK to RGB color conversion.

Metric Converter:
Converts between various metric units (e.g., pico, nano, kilo, mega, etc.)

Speed, Distance, and Time Calculations:
Calculates speed, time, and distance using basic formulas.

Computes escape velocity for different planets in the solar system.
Physics Calculations:
